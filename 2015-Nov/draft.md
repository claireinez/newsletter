To friends of FAC,

Welcome to the inaugural FAC newsletter! *rapturous applause*

We recently decided to start publishing a monthly newsletter to keep the community posted on our news, highlights and any opportunities to become involved with FAC again. We very much hope you enjoy.

#### FAC Developments

We are currently located in Bethnal Green, at 14 Palmers Road, in a space which is very dear to us. However, we are currently looking for another nest as we are growing very fast with the current cohort soon ending! If you are contact with anyone who could provide a place for running free education we would be hugely indebted to you.

#### FAC Calendar

FAC is holding its Christmas party on the 17th December, we hope you can join us at FAC HQ, which will be frantically decorated with some tinsel and baubles.

FAC6 is now in week 10, and so FAC7 is already on the horizon. We will be welcoming our next cohort on January 18th, so if you yourself are considering applying or know anyone who would be keen, our final deadline is on the 7th December. Do get in touch with us for more information.

#### Alumni project highlights

Two recent FAC graduates from the summer, Claire Mitchell and Michelle Garrett have run into some very quick success! Here's what Claire and Michelle had to say:  

"Two months ago, we went along to our very first hackathon! It was Startup Weekend - for Fashion & Tech. After three hours sleep curled up in booths at the venue and our first time making 100 git commits in a day... we won!! The startup was Mode For Me: a kickstarter for emerging designers. Our team of six designed and developed an MVP in one weekend, and onboarded 30 designers. 1st prize was a trip to Poland to compete at the Global Fashion Battle (where we kept up the winning streak). Keep an eye out for updates and our imminent (!!) launch in the new year. In the meantime, please do follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and let us know what you think of the site."

Well done Claire and Michelle! Michelle is now working with WonderLuk and Claire is at 27partners. The Instagram, Twitter and site URL are below:

#### FAC Goodbyes

We were very sad to lose Benjamin Lees to Arcadia group in late October. We wish him all the best in his role and hope to see him very soon. --Benji's bit--.

Thank you for reading! We shall see you in the next edition (and hopefully at the Christmas party).

Ta ta!
