# Newsletter

Content and structure of our monthly newsletter can be found here! It will be going out to 1500+ people and is a big part of our interaction with the outside world. Contributions **very welcome**.

Our gitter channel is below:

### Team

The newsletter team will be formed of a 'Chief Editor', and a 'Co-Editor' for a period of 4-6 months, at the end of which the co-editor will become the chief editor. We hope the chief editor will be an alumnus of FACx and the co-editor an alumnus of FACx+1.

### Content

We try to keep a **no-scroll** email to ensure everyone who receives it will read it!

### Possible features

* FAC Development - moving premises etc.
* FAC Calendar - events we're holding / attending
